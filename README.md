This project was done as part of an internship at OCP Group. The goal is to utilize online analysis for quality 
improvement in the manufacturing of DAP fertilizer, and use Power BI Dashboards for visualizations of this 
control system.

The HAVER CPA solution was used for collecting material from the bulk source, measurement, and analysis devices 
allowed for the online analysis of fertilizers' particles.

These are some of the characteristics of the DAP fertilizer particles:

We applied the Six Sigma Methodology to enhance the control system. Once the data is collected, we go on to the
data analysis and problem identification. In the Improve phase of the DMAIC approach, we aim to enhance the 
efficiency and accessibility of the corrective actions by introducing a user-friendly Flask interface. We use 
Windows PowerShell to allow communication between the data in our SQL server and PowerBI. The Power BI 
visualizations embedded in the Flask page provide dynamic and real-time insights into critical parameters 
associated with the diameter and circularity of the fertilizer particles. Operators can visually track 
variations and trends, making it easier to identify potential issues or deviations from the desired standards.
If dimensions of particles are not within the chosen range, operators must look at the corrective logical 
frameworks and identify the problem.
